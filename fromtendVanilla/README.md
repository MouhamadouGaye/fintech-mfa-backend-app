Account Management: CreateAccountDto, AccountDto
Transaction Management: TransactionDto, TransferDto, DepositDto, WithdrawalDto
API Responses: ApiResponse<T>, ErrorResponseDto

Enums

AccountType, TransactionType, TransactionStatus, UserRole for type safety

Frontend-Specific Interfaces

Authentication: LoginCredentials, UserSession
Filtering & Pagination: TransactionFilter, PagedResponse<T>
Dashboard: DashboardData, AccountBalance
Validation: ValidationError, FormErrors
Charts: ChartData, TransactionSummary

Key Features

Type Safety: All interfaces match your Java DTOs with proper TypeScript types
Optional Fields: Uses ? for optional properties
Generic Types: ApiResponse<T> and PagedResponse<T> for reusability
Frontend Utilities: Additional interfaces for common frontend needs like filtering, pagination, and dashboard data
Date Handling: Uses string type for dates (ISO format) as they come from JSON APIs

You can use these interfaces with any HTTP client (Axios, Fetch API) and state management solution (Redux, Zustand, Angular services) in your React or Angular application.R√©essayerMcan you please build the frontend using angular  19 pleaseModifierI'll create a complete Angular 19 banking application frontend for you.
